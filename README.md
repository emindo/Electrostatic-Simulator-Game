# Electrostatic-Simulator-Game
I made a game that uses electrostatic physics. The goal of this game is to maneuver a targeted charge towards an area using the forces from other placed charges. 

The project demonstrates the relationship between fundamental physic concepts like electrosttaics and kinematics.
